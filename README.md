## Pull requests

For a pull request, you:

 * Fork the repo (this will create a repo of your own)
 * In your copy of the repo, make changes in a certain branch (and commit them)
 * Don't forget to add the public repo as a remote, so that you can stay up to date with the latest changes. `git add remote upstream https://github.com/user/repo.git`
 * Create the pull request using the github page (preferably do it early and with the WIP tag in the title)
 * Write a good PR message (use the correct tags)
 * Accept comments, corrections etc and correct the code
