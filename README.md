## Pull requests

For a pull request, you:

 * Fork the repo (this will create a repo of your own)
 * In your copy of the repo, make changes in a certain branch (and commit them)
 * Don't forget to add the public repo as a remote, so that you can stay up to date with the latest changes. `git add remote upstream https://github.com/user/repo.git`
 * Create the pull request using the github page (preferably do it early and with the WIP tag in the title)
 * Write a good PR message (use the correct tags)
 * Accept comments, corrections etc and correct the code

## HashMap and custom classes.

I had a strange bug in a `PriorityQueue` I didn't implement (but I had to write unit tests for).
At some point I concluded that it was somehow related to a `HashMap` that was being used to keep track of the positions of every element in the tree: the reverse search used in `pq.decreasePriority(node,new_priority)` for some reason failed.
But why? I realized that it was because the HashMap wasn't working well with the data I was passing. It was actually overwriting everything to the same pair! That's how I realized (== googled and found out, link [here](https://dzone.com/articles/things-to-keep-in-mind-while-using-custom-classes)) that *it was calculating the same hash for all the different elements I passed.* The reason was that I was hashing a subclass that had only one extra field (adding to the inherited ones) and that I was creating new elements with the same value in that field, (even though the inherited fields had different values). To sum up, make sure to experiment with how a custom class is hashed in a `HashMap`
Additional points to consider
* Changing a field of an element changes its hash value. Therefore, it is treated as a new insertion by the `HashMap`
* Normally you shouldn't unit test private methods.
* Using toString on an object that doesn't define it just returns 1.
